[Anamika](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/fun-projects/edit/main/projects/Anamika.md) : Anamika is an innovative project aimed at recreating the ghostly character from the Malayalam movie "Romancham" using modern technologies. The project leverages Language Learning Models (LLMs), Speech-to-Text APIs, and 3D graphics to create an immersive experience where users can interact with Anamika through a virtual Ouija board.
