# Project Proposal: Conversational Recipe Assistant

## Project Overview:

We propose the development of a Flutter-based mobile application that utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT integration to provide users with a conversational recipe assistant. The application will allow users to search for recipes, filter results based on dietary preferences, and modify recipes to suit their tastes. Additionally, the application will feature speech-to-text functionality, enabling users to interact with the app using voice commands.

## Project Objectives:
1. ⁠Design and develop a user-friendly interface for searching, filtering, and displaying recipes.
2. ⁠Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT API to provide users with recipe suggestions and modifications.
3. ⁠Implement speech-to-text functionality using the Flutter ⁠ speech_to_text ⁠ package.
4. ⁠Integrate the speech-to-text functionality with the ChatGPT API.

## Project Scope:

The project will consist of the following features:
1. ⁠Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by ingredient, dish name, or cooking method.
2. ⁠Dietary Filtering: Users can filter recipes based on dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, etc.).
3. ⁠Ingredient Substitution: Users can ask the app to suggest alternative ingredients for a recipe.
4. ⁠Cooking Skill Adjustment: Users can ask the app to adjust the recipe complexity based on their cooking skills.
5. ⁠Recipe Modification: Users can ask the app to modify a recipe to suit their tastes (e.g., "make it spicier" or "add more protein").
6. ⁠Speech-to-Text Input: Users can click on the mic button near the chatbox to speak their input instead of typing.

### Stepwise Approach:

To complete this project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up the Project
- ⁠Create a new Flutter project in your preferred code editor.
- ⁠Add the necessary dependencies, including the OpenAI ChatGPT API client library and the Flutter ⁠ speech_to_text ⁠ package.

Step 2: Design the User Interface
- ⁠Sketch the user interface for the recipe search, filtering, and display screens.
- ⁠Implement the UI design using Flutter widgets.

Step 3: Integrate OpenAI ChatGPT API
- ⁠Read the OpenAI ChatGPT API documentation and understand the API endpoints and parameters.
- ⁠Implement the API calls to retrieve recipe suggestions and modifications.

Step 4: Implement Speech-to-Text Functionality
- ⁠Read the Flutter ⁠ speech_to_text ⁠ package documentation and understand how to use the package.
- ⁠Implement the speech-to-text functionality to recognize user speech and convert it to text.

Step 5: Integrate Speech-to-Text with ChatGPT API
- ⁠Integrate the speech-to-text functionality with the ChatGPT API to send user input and receive responses.

Step 6: Test and Refine
- ⁠Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all features are working as expected.
- ⁠Refine the application by fixing bugs, improving performance, and enhancing the user experience.
